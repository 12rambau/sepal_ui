    During this tutorial, everything will be presented in the documentation environment. Meaning that every example will be shown using a white theme which is not the default theme of SEPAL. 
   
    if you want to copy/paste any of these example, please remove the following lines: 
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        # correct colors for the documentation 
        # set to dark in SEPAL by default 
        import ipyvuetify as v
        v.theme.dark = False
