Example
=======

In this section, an example of each of our component will be given. You should refer to the **Content** documentation to get an exhaustive description of all our widgets and methods.

.. warning::

    **Requirements:**

    * Sepal activated account (if you want to develop in the platform)
    * knowledge of python and OOP

.. danger::

    During this tutorial, everything will be presented in the documentation environment. Meaning that every example will be shown using a white theme which is not the default theme of SEPAL.

    if you want to copy/paste any of these example, please remove the following lines:

    .. code-block::

        # correct colors for the documentation
        # set to dark in SEPAL by default
        import ipyvuetify as v
        v.theme.dark = False

.. danger::

    Any cell that are supposed to trigger kernel events will not work as the kernel is dead in the documentation. A executable kernel will soon be added.
